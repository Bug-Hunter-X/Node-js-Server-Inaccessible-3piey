# Node.js Server Inaccessibility Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue where a Node.js server starts successfully but remains inaccessible from external clients.  The problem might stem from incorrect port configuration, firewall rules, or other network-related issues.  The solution involves checking port availability, firewall settings, and potentially using a different port.

## Bug

The `server.js` file contains a simple HTTP server.  Although the server starts without errors, it may be unreachable from other machines or even from the same machine if other processes are bound to port 8080.

## Solution

The `serverSolution.js` file offers possible solutions such as:

* **Checking port availability:** Ensure that no other process is using port 8080.
* **Firewall configuration:** Verify that the firewall allows inbound connections on port 8080.
* **Using a different port:** Choose a different port number that is available and not blocked by a firewall.
